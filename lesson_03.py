# Lesson 03: Build on the Challenge in Second

# input()
# grade_str = input('Enter grade:')
# grade_int = int(grade_str)
# input validation

# loops
# for loop to run the program multiple times
# while loop for grabbing grades with input() until there is no more
# iteration counters

# Homework - work through the examples on these two pages -- will introduce some additional
#   features on loops like "break", "continue", etc
