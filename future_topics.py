# Functions

# Methods (use of): list methods (append), string methods (upper, lower)

# List comprehensions

# Run Respirosa scripts for DL training pipeline

# Run open source project based on librosa that does beat detection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOdbtPhbLU



# Build on the Challenge in Second with:

# grade >= 'C'

# input()
# grade_str = input('Enter grade:')
# grade_int = int(grade_str)

# loops
# for loop that runs a list of grades collected one at a time with input() or with a list sent to a function
# while loop for grabbing grades with input() until there is no more

# dictionary of student names and grades

# average grade of the students, histogram of grades, etc
